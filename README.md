## About

DiskPart is a partition management tool for the Amiga, built as a clean GadTools application that runs directly on Kickstart 3.x with no external library dependencies beyond the ROM. It was created out of a simple conviction: the Amiga deserves a good, modern partition editor — and it is better to have one now than never.

> *"Vibecoded software might be argued with, but this is an experiment in what AI-assisted development can produce when given a clear goal and a demanding user."*

## Requirements

- AmigaOS 3.x (Kickstart 3.1 or later recommended)
- Intuition, GadTools, DOS libraries (all standard ROM)
- ASL library optional (enables the Browse file requester in the filesystem driver dialog)

## Usage

Run `DiskPart` from the Shell or double-click from Workbench.

1. A device selector appears listing all detected disk controllers.
   Use **Filter / Show All** to toggle between storage-only and full device lists.
2. Select a device and click **Select** — a progress window shows each unit being probed.
3. Select a unit and click **Select** to open the partition editor.
4. Use the buttons along the bottom to manage partitions and filesystem drivers.
5. Click **Write** when satisfied to commit changes to disk.

## Building

Requires the Bartman/Abyss m68k-amigaos ELF toolchain.

```sh
make
```

Output: `out/DiskPart.exe`

## A Note on Vibecoding

This project was developed through AI-assisted ("vibecoded") collaboration — the architecture, decisions, and direction came from a human; the implementation was written by an AI. Whether that makes the software more or less trustworthy is a fair question. The answer offered here is: judge it by what it does, read the source if you want, and always keep a backup before touching partition tables.
